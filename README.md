## Notes from Glen
This challenge took me around 1.5hrs to complete and I believe it covers the Requirements. In terms of the bonus objectives I tried to cover those with a hoc that we could use on any route.
In an ideal world I would have swapped out a lot of css and used style components. With Style components we can use a ThemeProvider in order to set the theme and then the theme prop gets
injected into any other styled component which would allow us to adjust a global style for the app but I thought perhaps that would take the task too far of course. Looking forward to 
feedback. Thanks
